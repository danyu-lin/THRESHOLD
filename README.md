# **THRESHOLD : Threshold determination**

THRESHOLD is a command-line program to implement a bootstrap approach to determining genome-wide significance threshold for association tests in sequencing studies. It currently covers single-variant tests, Burden tests, and SKAT tests. We are working intensely to improve the capabilities of THRESHOLD, so please check back frequently for updates.
